# Start UP Database API

This API is built for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. You may optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

## Usage

### Authentication

This API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To use the API, you will need to include an Authorization header with a valid JWT token in your requests. To obtain a token, you will need to send a POST request to /api/users/login with a valid email and password in the request body.
